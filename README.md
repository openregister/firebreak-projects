## Welcome to GOV.UK Registers Firebreak Projects

Several times a year, the team spends a week pitching and collaborating on self-directed ideas. We put what we build or prototype here so that others can contribute to the code, or just take a look at what we've been thinking about. 

### January 2018

The projects the team are working on in the January 2018 firebreak are: 

## Upvote a Register
**A page that includes options to:**
- express interest as a potential data source - provide contact details to the GOV.UK Registers Team (not public)
- express interest as a potential user (publicly visible as a +1 for that register)
- provide contact details & service description/link/name to GOV.UK Registers Team (not public)

**code:** [https://github.com/openregister/registers-upvote](https://github.com/openregister/registers-upvote)

**readme:** [https://github.com/openregister/registers-upvote/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/openregister/registers-upvote/blob/master/README.md_)

**deployed prototype:** [https://registers-upvote.herokuapp.com/registers](https://registers-upvote.herokuapp.com/registers)


## Registers Sprint 
**A sprint-by-sprint list of what we're doing and learning that:**
- documents achieved milestones for each sprint
- documents user research findings

**code:** [https://github.com/openregister/registers_sprint_by_sprint](https://github.com/openregister/registers_sprint_by_sprint)

**readme:** [https://github.com/openregister/registers_sprint_by_sprint/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/openregister/registers_sprint_by_sprint/blob/master/README.md)

## Create your own temporary Register
A mini-service that lets you explore your own data through the registers model. 
You will be able to 
- Upload your own data 
- Use existing fields or link to existing registers
- Create new fields specific to your subject area
- Mock up a register for your data and share it with colleagues, or even use it in a prototype service

**code:** [https://github.com/openregister/firebreak-2018](https://github.com/openregister/firebreak-2018)

**deployed prototype:** [https://firebreak-2018.herokuapp.com](https://firebreak-2018.herokuapp.com)

## address-lookup frontend 
Frontend for [hmrc/address-lookup](https://github.com/hmrc/address-lookup)
